**ReGuilded** is like **BetterDiscord** for [Guilded](https://guilded.gg).  We make it easy to inject CSS (Themes) and JS (Addons) into your desktop Guilded client, and provide a repository of Themes and Addons to choose from.

## Installation

Up-to-date installation instructions during our Alpha period can be found at [this doc on our Guilded server](https://www.guilded.gg/ReGuilded/groups/k3yaNW83/channels/6084b1dd-7110-47e7-a579-62f8a33b0fe1/docs/255221).

## Will you get banned for using ReGuilded?

We have contacted Guilded asking if a modified client would be grounds for an account ban, and they had this to say:

> Unfortunately, we can't grant official permission to develop a third-party application outside of the scope of our upcoming public API. There are a lot of legal reasons for this (and I wish this weren't the case), but doing so can open us up to legal liability and/or make it difficult for us to enforce our IP rights against bad actors when we really need to do so.
> 
> That said, internally we have a non-action policy against developers that use our brand and/or internal APIs in good faith in order to help develop a better ecosystem for our users and communities. And while this should not be construed as a legal guarantee, I believe that what you described above would fall into this category.

It seems that Guilded is reserving the right to ban users for using altered clients, but they are only planning to do so when an altered client is used in bad faith.  Therefore, ReGuilded seems to be in the clear regarding account bans.

**However, please read the above quote and make your own decision before using ReGuilded. Be sure to also read [our license](https://github.com/ReGuilded/ReGuilded/blob/main/LICENSE).**
