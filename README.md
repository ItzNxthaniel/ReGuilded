**ReGuilded** is a client injector/client mod that allows you to extend the functionality of Guilded's client by providing theme and add-on support.

> **NOTE:** ReGuilded isn't fully stable and you may encounter some bugs or short-comings. We are looking for more contributors working on ReGuilded.

## Installation

You can use the Easy Installer located on our [website](https://reguilded.dev/downloads).
Or alternatively you can also download it from [github](https://github.com/reguilded/reguilded-setup/releases).

## Will you get banned for using ReGuilded?

ReGuilded is not associated with Guilded in any capacity. We have sought permission, and Guilded has confirmed that it will take no action using ReGuilded. However, abusing the mod using plugins or any other means to violate [Guilded TOU](https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360039728313-Terms-of-Use) could result in your account being banned.
